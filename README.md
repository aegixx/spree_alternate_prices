====================

Adds alternate product prices that can be applied via Promotions.  Adds a category to the Price model that is ignored until specifically referenced.

Installation
------------

Add spree_alternate_prices to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_alternate_prices'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_alternate_prices:install
```

Add Calculator to config/initializers/spree.rb configuration:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.spree.calculators.promotion_actions_create_item_adjustments << Spree::Calculator::AlternatePriceCalculator
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
